# Create a _real_ Website

If you did [step 3](./markdown-website.md) - you will see, that there is not much to do with CSS and Javascript. If you want to keep your GitHub Page, go ahead and [add some styles as stated in this tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/customizing-css-and-html-in-your-jekyll-theme/).

You can also upload a HTML based website, independently from the GitHub Markdown.

## Get a HTML website template

1. Clone the repository, so you have your files localy
2. Download a free template, [like this one](https://colorlib.com/wp/template/vcard2/)
  - extract the files, and open the directory with Atom
  - open the website localy by right clicking the file `about.html` and choose `open in Browser`
  - see, the template is fancy responsive
  - review the code


## Customize the website template  

1. edit the files
  - rename about.html to index.html globally in code, too
  - do not remove the credits at the footer
  - you might want to remove the contact form, since we do not have a server for actually sending emails. But if you are curious, use this [service for static contact forms](https://formspree.io/).
2. replace the images with correct sizes ones
  - free images at wikimedia Commons (mind the license)
  - [Example Profile Image](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Portrait_Placeholder.png)
3. push the code to the GitHub Page repository
